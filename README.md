# Dark Arduino Theme

### NOTE  
**Sadly, I'm no longer maintaining this theme. The Arduino IDE has changed a lot but I'm not doing much work with the platform and it's just too much to keep this up-to-date.** If you'd like to fork the repo and fix it, that would be great! I'll happily add a link to your version here so others can benefit.

Still works for Arduino version 1.8.5+, not tested with newer/older versions.

### INSTALLATION  

* Mac users should look in `/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside, the `splash.png`,`splash.bmp`, `about.png` with the ones from the DarkArduinoTheme folder (making a copy of the original in case want to revert back).
* Windows is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib`.  
* Linux will be in `/usr/share/arduino/lib/` â€“ note you may need to install the Arduino IDE from the Arduino site, not a place like Ubuntu Software  

#### Replace the `theme` folder and the `splash` and `about` images

### CREATING YOUR OWN MODS
The newest version of the Arduino IDE makes creating custom themes trickier: you now need to edit the `theme.txt` file, an XML file inside the `syntax` folder, and the button files. Unfortunately, not all items in the `theme.txt` file actually work, so if you can't get an item to change, try another one of the files.
