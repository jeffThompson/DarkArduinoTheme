####INSTALLATION
1. **PREFERENCES.TXT**  
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine - note the only main change is setting `editor.antialias` to true, which makes your fonts look WAY better!  
2. **THEME FOLDER**  
Look in `~/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (making a copy of the original in case want to revert back)  
 
####Rinksrides2013 Mods:
Added ColorPack_newIcons folder containing all the different colors to the action buttons in the IDE. The new Icons were hand drawn & colors modified in GIMP for windows. All you need to do is MOVE/COPY the buttons.gif from the theme folder above to a safe location, and COPY one of the "button.gif" files back to the theme folder from within one of the ColorPack_newIcons color folders. The folders are structured so that you dont have to rename the new buttons.gif, COPY/PASTE/REBOOT and your new icons and colors will appear! Don't forget to save the original in a safe place in case you want the original Icons and colors back.<b>There should only be ONE buttons.gif file in that directory DO NOT OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL "buttons.gif"!!</b>
